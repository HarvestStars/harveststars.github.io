<h2>"Cease to code and you cease to live."</h2>

My name is Xiaoxuan Zhang(张小轩), and I am a senior software engineer in 
<a href="https://www.mavenir.com/">Mavenir</a> in the <b>SDAAS</b> team,
where I leads the High-Availability development of the element control platform.
My research interests are primarily in the area of blockchain, quantitative trading platform and strategies, and high-performance software engineering.
Recently, I am pareparing for the further research of parallel computing in CPU and GPU, based on my previous project <a href="https://github.com/HarvestStars/poc-parallel-plotter">poc-parallel-plotter</a>.
Meanwhile, I am also passionate about the applied artificial intelligence, and I am still working on the construction of my machine learning-based quantitative trading platform, <a href="https://github.com/GeekChomolungma">GeekChomolungma</a>.
<p> </p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p> 
I got my degree from <a href="https://www.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University</a>(B.Eng. in 2013, and M.Eng. in 2015), my major was Automation Engineering. 
During 2013 and 2015, I worked and studied in <a href="https://faculty.whu.edu.cn/show.jsp?lang=en&n=Zhang%20Shirong">Shirong Zhang's</a> group, doing optimization of Support Vector Machine(SVM) in electrical and industrial sectors.
This paper is the about my former research results, see <a href="http://www.xml-data.org/WHDXXBGXB/html/318281fa-81fb-44f3-a414-9e978380bab3.htm">&lt;Optimal sparseness approach for least square support vector machine based on PSO&gt;</a>. In 2015, I joined the <a href="https://www.snerdi.com.cn/">Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research&Design Institute</a> as an instrument engineer. Three years later, I switched careers and became a programmer, where I am now.

</p>• Experienced with LaTeX

</p><h2>Selected Github Projects</h2>
</p> 1. <em><a href="https://github.com/lavaio/lava">Lava</a></em> is one of my most proud work. It is a block chain similar to bitcoin, popular with Chinese cryptocurrency miners and fans. Actually, I developed Lava based on bitcoin's P2P network protocol and a concept of a consensus named Proof of Capacity. I spent almost two years reading papers and codes, designing the prototype and implementation.
</p> 2. <em><a href="https://github.com/GeekChomolungma">GeekChomolungma</a></em> is a quantitative platform. It is built up to do quantitative trading in specific cryptocurrency exchanges. You could add your own strategies coded by python in it. 
</p> 3. <em><a href="https://github.com/lavaio/lava-miner">lava-miner</a></em>, the cryptocurrency miner for Lava, which is based on CPU computing instruction set. There is a related work assisted by me based on GPU calculation, which is still in private status in the Lavaio repo.
</p> 4. <em><a href="https://github.com/HarvestStars/uniswap-go">Uniswap-simulator</a></em>, A simulator of the renowned cryptocurrency exchange -- <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>. I developed it after reading its <a href="https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>.
</p> 5. <em><a href="https://github.com/HarvestStars/AES-GCM">AES-GCM</a></em>, An optimal aesgcm algorithm.
