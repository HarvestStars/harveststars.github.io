My name is Xiaoxuan Zhang(张小轩), and I was a senior software engineer in 
<a href="https://www.mavenir.com/">Mavenir</a> in the <b>SDAAS</b> team,
where I leads the High-Availability development of the element control platform.
My research interests are primarily in the area of blockchain, quantitative trading platform and strategies, and high-performance software engineering with GPU(CUDA).
Now, I quit my job and went to Netherlands to obtain my second master degree in Computational Science in UvA. Meanwhile I am still working on the construction of my GPU based quantitative trading platform, <a href="https://github.com/GeekChomolungma">GeekChomolungma</a>. 
<p> </p>
The <a href="https://github.com/GeekChomolungma">GeekChomolungma</a> platform's fundamental development process involves initially constructing the database and network infrastructure using C++. Next, we establish a foundational strategy library by refining and testing strategies sourced from the open community on <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/community">TradingView</a>. Afterward, we utilize CUDA to enhance these strategies, optimizing for parallel computation across multiple assets. Finally, we simulate live trading to record profit and loss metrics.

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p> 
I got my degree from <a href="https://www.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University</a>(B.Eng. in 2013, and M.Eng. in 2015), my major was Automation Engineering. 
During 2013 and 2015, I worked and studied in <a href="https://faculty.whu.edu.cn/show.jsp?lang=en&n=Zhang%20Shirong">Shirong Zhang's</a> group, doing optimization of Support Vector Machine(SVM) in electrical and industrial sectors.
This paper is the about my former research results, see <a href="http://www.xml-data.org/WHDXXBGXB/html/318281fa-81fb-44f3-a414-9e978380bab3.htm">&lt;Optimal sparseness approach for least square support vector machine based on PSO&gt;</a>. In 2015, I joined the <a href="https://www.snerdi.com.cn/">Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research&Design Institute</a> as an instrument engineer. Three years later, I switched careers and became a programmer. Then after 6 years later, I came back to university for my further study in High Performance Computing, where I am now.

</p><h2>Selected Github Projects</h2>
</p> 1. <em><a href="https://github.com/lavaio/lava">Lava</a></em> is one of my most proud work. It is a block chain similar to bitcoin, I developed Lava based on bitcoin's P2P network protocol and a concept of a consensus named Proof of Capacity.
</p> 2. <em><a href="https://github.com/GeekChomolungma">GeekChomolungma</a></em> is a quantitative platform based on C++ and CUDA. It is built up to do quantitative trading in specific cryptocurrency exchanges. I am still working on it, and I want to make it a plug-in strategy platform. 
</p> 3. <em><a href="https://github.com/lavaio/lava-miner">lava-miner</a></em>, the cryptocurrency miner for Lava, which is based on CPU computing instruction set. There is a related work assisted by me based on GPU calculation, which is still in private status in the Lavaio repo.
</p> 4. <em><a href="https://github.com/HarvestStars/uniswap-go">Uniswap-simulator</a></em>, A simulator of the renowned cryptocurrency exchange -- <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>. I developed it after reading its <a href="https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>.
